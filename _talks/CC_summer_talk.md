Presented research findings at Colorado College’s annual Summer Research and Internship Symposium. The project was conducted during my Junior Year Summer RA position at the College's Mathematics and Computer Science Department. The project investigated the influence of location, race, and gender on U.S. women’s intergenerational socioeconomic mobility.
