**Abtract:** The U.S. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is often framed as a conservation initiative, yet it also functions as one of the largest agricultural transfer programs, paying farmers annual rents to retire land from production. These payments offer income stability but prohibit production on that land for a decade. Despite the program’s scale, little is known about how farmers weigh this tradeoff or how risk preferences shape their decisions. This paper develops a dynamic land-allocation model to study that decision. Each year, farmers choose how much land to allocate between crop production, which faces stochastic prices and yields, and the CRP with a two-year lock-in. Calibrating the model to county-level Iowa corn-grain producers reveals that even risk-neutral farmers allocate a substantial share (72\% of the limit) to the CRP, and that risk aversion amplifies participation, though with pronounced spatial heterogeneity. Within counties, CRP allocation falls sharply with farm size, and the model predicts that at the observed average farmer constant relative risk aversion ($\gamma = 4.2$), the model predicts that enrollment exceeds the current state cap by 1.3 million acres and county-level caps by an average of 13,100 acres. Taken together, the results suggest that uniform acreage caps are misaligned with local risk conditions and heterogeneous preferences, limiting the program’s ability to act as effective income insurance.
