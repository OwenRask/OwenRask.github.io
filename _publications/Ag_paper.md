title: "Don't Put All Your Acres in One Basket: Heterogeneous Risk Preferences in CRP Participation"
collection: publications
category: workingpapers
permalink: /publication/Ag_paper
excerpt: 'The U.S. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is often framed as a conservation initiative, yet it also functions as one of the largest agricultural transfer programs, paying farmers annual rents to retire land from production. Despite the programâ€™s scale, little is known about how farmers weigh this tradeoff or how risk preferences shape their decisions. This paper develops a dynamic land-allocation model to study that decision.'
