**Abstract:** This paper analyzes multigenerational trends in U.S. socioeconomic mobility using NLSY79 and NLSY97 data, with a focus on maternal role models. First, relative mobility results are sensitive to how we proxy for lifetime income; however, absolute upward mobility has risen by 2–4 ranks since the 1960s. Black Americans are the only group whose mobility has declined. Second, the mother’s employment role model effect on daughters' mobility strengthens across generations and is robust across income definitions. An employed mother increases her daughter’s lifetime employment likelihood by 4–6 percentage points, driven by black and white women. However, in the NLSY97 cohort, it is linked to a nearly three-rank decline in daughters’ upward mobility.
