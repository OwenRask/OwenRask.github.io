I am Predoctoral Fellow at the [Tobin Center for Economic Policy](https://tobin.yale.edu/people/owen-rask) at Yale University. My primary research interests in applied microeconomics, agriculture, and policy design. My work combines structural modeling, quasi-experimental methods, large-scale administrative data, and program evaluation to understand how individuals and firms heterogeneously respond to incentives and constraints.

My recent projects span topics such as dynamic models of farmersâ€™ land-allocation decisions under the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program, and the role of mother role models in shaping their daughters intergenerational mobility. Across these areas, I emphasize careful empirical design, the use of administrative and survey microdata, and structural modeling to better understand behavior.

Looking ahead, my goal is to produce research that informs policy design by identifying not just average effects, but also who benefits, who bears costs, and how heterogeneity in preferences and constraints matters. Ultimately, I aim to contribute to an economics that connects rigorous technical work with real-world impact.
